Remix loads for the very first time \\nii. A new workspace is created with 'Default' template\\niii. There are no files existing in the File Explorer\\n\\nThis workspace contains 3 directories:\\n\\n1. 'contracts': Holds three contracts with increasing levels of complexity.\\n2. 'scripts': Contains four typescript files to deploy a contract. It is explained below.\\n3. 'tests': Contains one Solidity test file for 'Ballot' contract & one JS test file for 'Storage' contract.\\n\\nSCRIPTS\\n\\nThe 'scripts' folder has four typescript files which help to deploy the 'Storage' contract using 'web3.js' and 'ethers.js' libraries.\\n\\nFor the deployment of any other contract, just update the contract's name from 'Storage' to the desired contract and provide constructor arguments accordingly \\nin the file `deploy_with_ethers.ts` or  `deploy_with_web3.ts`\\n\\nIn the 'tests' folder there is a script containing Mocha-Chai unit tests for 'Storage' contract.\\n\\nTo run a script, right click on file name in the file explorer and click 'Run'. Remember, Solidity file must already be compiled.\\nOutput from script will appear in remix terminal.\\n\\nPlease note, require/import is supported in a limited manner for Remix supported modules.\\nFor now, modules supported by Remix are ethers, web3, swarmgw, chai, multihashes, remix and hardhat only for hardhat.ethers object/plugin.\\nFor unsupported modules, an error like this will be thrown: '<module_name> module require is not supported by Remix IDE' will be shown.\\n\";"],"names":[],"sourceRoot":""}
